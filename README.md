# Polaris Find Tool SQL Queries
The purpose of this repository is to provide examples of SQL queries used in the Polaris Integrated Library System Find Tool. Most documentation and user-provided examples target those with access to server-side management. Those queries, for the most part, are not compatible with the Find Tool, which more Polaris users have access to.

SQL searches in the Find Tool are a powerful way to do advanced searches, and I think it's a shame that more Polaris library workers are not empowered to use them.
